## Abstract
Natural and human-made common goods present key challenges due to their susceptibility to degradation, overuse, or congestion. We explore the self-organisation of their usage when individuals have access to several available commons but limited information on them. We propose an extension of the Win-Stay, Lose-Shift (WSLS) strategy for such systems, under which individuals use a resource repeatedly until they are unsuccessful and then shift randomly.
We show that the simple, completely decentralised principle behind this strategy leads to a more balanced use of commons, without the need for communication between individuals, nor a governing institution to direct individuals on which option to use.
Selective individuals who retain information on their usage and accordingly adapt their tolerance to failure in each common good improve the average experienced quality for the entire population, which even in hybrid populations allow self-organisation into an ideal distribution with equalised experienced quality across common goods.
We show that these results can be applied to the server selection problem faced by mobile users accessing Internet services and we perform realistic simulations to test their validity. Furthermore, they can be used to understand %other real systems such as animal dispersal on grazing and foraging land, to propose solutions to operators of systems of public transport or other technological commons, and to address problems of common goods usage in social systems resorting to decentralised policies rather than control-oriented political solutions.
